# todolist-php-mysql-tailwind
you can see this project on https://simplecrud.epizy.com

for learning purpose, you can create database on your local storage (localhost). but if you wanna deploy it as a project, make sure that you have created your own database on server, not local on your pc.
i recommended infinityfree.net for php language like this one (hosting and config database).
after that, you can fill the code that i've set for you with your own database information.
make sure to set the table name and the field name based from the code that i've made.

table name : todolist_apps
field name : id, task, priority, date_created

definitely u can change the name according to you, but you should change the name in the code as well.

note that i using tailwind cdn for development. if you have done with your code, install it as a PostCSS plugin or use the Tailwind CLI: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
